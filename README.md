• A practice password registration system, this program automatically encrypts and decrypts data, while also not storing
info within the program. This program is also a single text file, so each piece of data is stored seperated by delimiters.
The users info is found through an ID system associated with each account, once the user enters correct data, the program searches 
the database for that ID. It then associates each password and other data with a dataID, which is how we can determine what to 
compare without directly storing it.

• it also features a fully working password reset system, I which includes re-encrypting that new data by pulling the account ID. 
 
• this a freestyling learning project, so redundancies are expected.
